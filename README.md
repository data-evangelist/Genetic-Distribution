A Survey on the Unique Characteristics of the Human Genome at the DNA Level

The human genome consists of over 3 billion base pairs of DNA. But it turns out that most of the sequence are non-coding for RNA and proteins. Only a small fraction (<2%) of the base pairs actually encode information that makes us who we are. This study is an exploratory data analysis of the distribution of these variable DNA fragments, known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The pattern of distribution may provide insights to the process of human evolution.
